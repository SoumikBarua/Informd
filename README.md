# Informd
Our project for the MLH Fellowship Orientation Hackathon

## About

This purpose of this project is to learn about React Native and how it is used to build native apps. Given how popular React Native is and its prevalance as a required or a desired skill on the job market, it is important to learn about this technology. Also, it is pretty neat to be able to develop a single application that deploys to both Android and iOS.

## Tools we used

We built it using VS Code. We also used the Expo platform to run the app, on simulator and physical devices. We also used Canva/Figma. Git was our version control system and GitHub was our team collaboration tool.


## Challenges we ran into
 <ul>
 <li>Setting up our development environments</li>
 <li>Learning how components, state and props work in React Native</li>
 <li>Package managers and library imports</li>
 </ul>
 
## What we learned

We learned quite a bit of git workflow with several branches, PRs and merges. We also learned that React Native has a lot of support libraries. It was also cool to find out how React Native maps it's UI objects to the native elements. Lastly, we learned the basics of JavaScript & React Native.
